# halo
Simulation of colliding Bose-Einstein condensates in producing momentum-correlated pairs of atoms.
S-wave scattering and T-F approximation are used in the simulation model.
Scattering halo qualitatively resembling experiments are produced and data analysis is undertaken to quantify number squeezing and momentum correlation.
